# Datasets

This repo contains datasets that we use in our demos.

## Downloading files from datasets repository
We had problem with reading quiz.csv file directly from its GitHub url:

```
library(readr)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstats-tartu/datasets/master/quiz.csv"
quiz <â€“ read_csv(url)
```
For some people using `read_csv()` directly with url gave an error.
Here's simple workaround: first download this quiz.csv file and then import to R, see below. 

**Get file url**.
Click on the file name you want to download. 
You need to see raw contents of the file. 
Find button "Raw" and click on it, you will see raw text.
Copy url from browser.

**Download file**. 
First, we create folder called "data" to host all necessary data files. 

```
dir.create("data")
```

Function will issue a warning when dir already exists.

First download file into "data" directory:
``` 
download.file(url, "data/quiz.csv")
```

**Read file**:
```
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

quiz <- read_csv("data/quiz.csv")
quiz
```
This can be used with all other files too. 
Just change url and file name accordingly.


Imported **quiz data** needs some munging:
```
colnames(quiz) <- c("time","education", "supervision", "stats_course",
                    "analysed_data", "proficiency", "junk", "plan_before",
                    "decide_after","publication_bias","publish_all",
                    "collect_more","different_method")

## Let's fix education to numeric
quiz <- mutate_at(quiz, "education", parse_number)

## Remove one non-question
quiz <- select(quiz, -junk)
quiz
```

**Download and import json file**:

Cancer datasets from [Estonian Health Statistics database](http://pxweb.tai.ee/PXWeb2015/index_en.html):

- "cancer_newcases_PK10.json", PK10: New cases of malignant neoplasms by specified site, sex and age group.

- "cancer_incidence_PK30.json", PK30: Age-specific incidence rate of malignant neoplasms per 100 000 inhabitants by site and sex.

**Download** "cancer_newcases_PK10.json" file from this GitHub repo ("rstats-tartu/datasets") similarly as shown above:
```
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstats-tartu/datasets/master/cancer_newcases_PK10.json"
dir.create("data")
download.file(url, "data/cancer_newcases_PK10.json")
```

**To import** this downloaded file into R you can use "boulder" package function `json_to_df()`:
```
# devtools::install_github("tpall/boulder")
library(boulder)
path <- "data/cancer_newcases_PK10.json"
incidence <- json_to_df(path)
incidence
```

## Average monthly wage with additional payments

**healthcare_personnel_salary.tsv** contains data about "average monthly wage with additional payments" of full- and part-time health care personnel for different occupations from all age groups [Estonian Health Statistics database](http://pxweb.tai.ee/PXWeb2015/pxweb/en/04THressursid/04THressursid__06THTootajatePalk/TT09.px/table/tableViewLayout2/?rxid=466b62f2-f258-4e9a-9590-4a4ac41c7513). Values are in euros.


**Download this file**:
```
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstats-tartu/datasets/master/healthcare_personnel_salary.tsv"
dir.create("data")
download.file(url, "data/healthcare_personnel_salary.tsv")
```
**Import this file**:
```
library(readr)
salary <- read_tsv("data/healthcare_personnel_salary.tsv")
```

## Mean annual population

**mean_annual_population.csv**: PO0211 MEAN ANNUAL POPULATION by Sex, Year and Age group dataset is from [Statistics Estonia database](http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=PO0211&ti=MEAN+ANNUAL+POPULATION+BY+SEX+AND+AGE+GROUP&path=../I_Databas/Population/01Population_indicators_and_composition/04Population_figure_and_composition/&lang=1).

*"mean_annual_population.csv" was processed from "rawdata/PO0211.csv" using "R/mean_annual_pop.R" script.*

Mean annual population is defined by Statistics Estonia as half the sum number of the population at the beginning and at the end of the year.

**Download this file**:
```
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstats-tartu/datasets/master/mean_annual_population.csv"
dir.create("data")
download.file(url, "data/mean_annual_population.csv")
```
**Import this file**:
```
library(readr)
pop <- read_csv("data/mean_annual_population.csv")
```
