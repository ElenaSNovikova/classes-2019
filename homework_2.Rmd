```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


- Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(glue::glue("plots/fig{1:6}.png"))
```

- Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

- Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

- What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg (fuel consumption)? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```
