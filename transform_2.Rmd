```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load tidyverse library and dataset:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
```

Import viruses.csv file from data subfolder, note that some genes and proteins values are labelled with "-", we consider them missing values and assign NA to them: 
```{r}
viruses <- read_csv(here("data", "viruses.csv"), na = c(NA, "-"))
viruses
```


## Add new variables with mutate()


- mutate() allows you to modify or create new variables (columns) in a dataset.   
- mutate works on vectors!   
- mutate does not reduce/change the number of rows in tibble!   


Based on viruses dataset, there are not many questions that we would ask that need creation of new variables. 

However, based on genome size and number of genes and proteins we can calculate gene density per kb:

Let's create smaller more focussed dataset:
```{r}
orf_density <- select(viruses, organism_name, tax_id, size_kb, genes, proteins)
orf_density
```

For start, we can see that some viruses have either genes or proteins missing. 

We can create new variable where we fill in missing gene numbers with protein number if available:

dplyr has function case_when() that vectorises multiple if and else if statements:

```{r}
orf_density <- mutate(orf_density, orfs = case_when(
  is.na(genes) ~ proteins,
  TRUE ~ genes
))
orf_density
```

Here we created new variable "orfs" and assigned proteins number to it in cases where we had missing gene number. All other cases (TRUE) we assigned genes value to orfs.

Now we are ready to calculate number of orfs per kb:

```{r}
orf_density <- mutate(orf_density, orfs_kb = orfs / size_kb)
```


Excercise: move orfs_kb column into third place after taxonomy columns:

```{r}
select(orf_density, 1:2, orfs_kb, everything())
```


There is also transmute (?transmute) a close cousin of mutate that drops all other columns except the new modified column: 
```{r}
transmute(orf_density, orfs_kb = orfs / size_kb)
```


Excercise: plot distribution of size_kb:

```{r}
ggplot(orf_density) +
  geom_histogram(aes(orfs_kb), bins = 30) +
  scale_x_log10()
```




## Useful creation functions

There are many functions for creating new variables that you can use with mutate(). 

> The key property is that the function must be vectorised: it must take a vector of values as input, return a vector with the same number of values as output. 

Some of the functions are familiar from base R class: 
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, ^.

Arithmetic operators are also useful in conjunction with the aggregate functions. 

For example, x / sum(x) calculates the proportion of a total, and y - mean(y) computes the difference from the mean.

Let's calculate the difference og gc value from the mean for each taxon:
```{r}
viruses %>% 
  mutate(dgc = gc / mean(gc, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(1:2, gc, dgc)
```


- Modular arithmetic: %/% (integer division) and %% (remainder, modulus), where x == y * (x %/% y) + (x %% y). 

Modular arithmetic is a handy tool because it allows you to break integers up into pieces. For example, in the tidyverse flights dataset, you can compute hour and minute from dep_time with:

To demonstrate modulo and integer division, let's quickly introduce new dataset:
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

Here we are, modulo and integer arithmetic operators to wrangle data, note the use of transmute:
```{r}
transmute(flights,
  dep_time,
  hour = dep_time %/% 100,
  minute = dep_time %% 100
)
```

- Logs: log(), log2(), log10(). Note that log() converts to natural logarithm.

To demonstrate logs in action, we can look at the virus genome size. 

Seems that they are not normally distributed... and most of the values are concentrated at the left side.
```{r}
ggplot(data = viruses) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = size_kb), bins = 30)
```

We can have better look at the distibution by using log transformaton.

First we take only unique tax_id and size_kb combinations.

```{r}
vir_taxa <- select(viruses, tax_id, size_kb) %>% distinct()
vir_taxa <- mutate(vir_taxa, log_size_kb = log10(size_kb))
ggplot(data = vir_taxa) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = log_size_kb), bins = 30)
```


```{r}
log(0 + 0.01)
```


- Offsets: lead() and lag() allow you to refer to leading or lagging values. This allows you to compute running differences (e.g. x - lag(x)) or find when values change (x != lag(x)).

```{r}
(x <- 1:10)
lag(x)
?lag
lead(x)
```

- Cumulative and rolling aggregates: R provides functions for running sums, products, mins and maxes: cumsum(), cumprod(), cummin(), cummax(); 
and dplyr provides cummean() for cumulative means.

```{r}
cumsum(x)
cummean(x)
```

- Ranking: there are a number of ranking functions, but you should start with min_rank(). 

It does the most usual type of ranking (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th).

```{r}
(y <- c(1, 2, 2, NA, 3, 4))
min_rank(y)
min_rank(desc(y))
```

Let's pick largest virus in each subclass:
```{r}

```



There are also row_number(), dense_rank(), percent_rank(), cume_dist(), ntile():
```{r}
row_number(y)
dense_rank(y)
percent_rank(y)
cume_dist(y)
```

### Exercises

- Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they're not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

```{r}
flights
```


## Grouped summaries with summarise()

The last key verb is summarise(). It collapses a data frame to a single row:
```{r}
summarise(transactions, 
          transactions = mean(transactions),
          price_total = mean(price_total, na.rm = TRUE)
          )
```

summarise() is not terribly useful unless we pair it with group_by(). This changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. 

Then, when you use the dplyr verbs on a grouped data frame they'll be automatically applied "by group". 

For example, if we applied exactly the same code to a data frame grouped by county, we get the average price volume of transactions per county:
```{r}
(by_county <- group_by(transactions, county))
```

```{r}
summarise(by_county, 
          transactions = mean(transactions),
          price_total = mean(price_total, na.rm = TRUE)
          )
```


> Together group_by() and summarise() provide one of the tools that you'll use most commonly when working with dplyr: grouped summaries. 

## Combining multiple operations with the pipe

Imagine that we want to explore the mean_volume_per_month per county for large apartments (area == "70-249,99"). Using what you know about dplyr, you might write code like this (step by step, no pipes!):

```{r}

```

Visualise summarised data by bargraph: 
```{r}

```



There are four steps to prepare this data:

- Group transactions by county and area.

- Summarise to compute total volume.

- Filter to include only large 70-245 m2 apartments.

- we rearranged column order by select + everything


This code is a little frustrating to write because we have to give each intermediate data frame a name, even though we don't care about it. Naming things is hard, so this slows down our analysis.

There's another way to tackle the same problem with the pipe, %>%:

Previous code with pipes:
```{r}

```


This focuses on the transformations, not what's being transformed, which makes the code easier to read. You can read it as a series of imperative statements: group, then summarise, then filter. As suggested by this reading, a good way to pronounce %>% when reading code is "then".

> Behind the scenes, x %>% f(y) turns into f(x, y), and x %>% f(y) %>% g(z) turns into g(f(x, y), z) and so on. You can use the pipe to rewrite multiple operations in a way that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. 

## Missing values, again
What about this na.rm argument in summary function. What happens if we don't set it?
```{r}

```

We get a lot of missing values! That's because aggregation functions obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. 

## Counts

Whenever you do any aggregation, it's always a good idea to include either a count (n()), or a count of non-missing values (sum(!is.na(x))).

Calculate mean of total price per county and apartment area and count number of rows:
```{r}

```


## Useful summary functions

R provides many useful summary functions:

- Measures of location: we have used mean(x), but median(x) is also useful. It's sometimes useful to combine aggregation with logical subsetting.


Here, we calculate average total price for comparison also for rows with more than 100 transactions. ungroup() is necessary for filter function in this context:
```{r}
transactions %>% 
  group_by(county, area) %>% 
  summarise(Av_total_price = mean(price_total, na.rm = TRUE),
            Av_total_price100 = mean(price_total[transactions > 100], na.rm = TRUE),
            N = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(.))
```

- Measures of spread: sd(x), IQR(x), mad(x). The mean squared deviation, or standard deviation or sd for short, is the standard measure of spread. The interquartile range IQR() and median absolute deviation mad(x) are robust equivalents that may be more useful if you have outliers

```{r}
transactions %>% 
  group_by(county, area) %>% 
  summarise(Mean_total_price = mean(price_total, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD_total_price = sd(price_total, na.rm = TRUE),
            N = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(SD_total_price))
```

- Measures of rank: min(x), quantile(x, 0.25), max(x). Quantiles are a generalisation of the median. For example, quantile(x, 0.25) will find a value of x that is greater than 25% of the values, and less than the remaining 75%.

```{r}
transactions %>% 
  group_by(county, area) %>% 
  summarise(min_tot_price = min(price_total, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_tot_price = max(price_total, na.rm = TRUE),
            difference = max_tot_price - min_tot_price) %>% 
  arrange(desc(difference))
```

- Measures of position: first(x), nth(x, 2), last(x). These work similarly to x[1], x[2], and x[length(x)] but let you set a default value if that position does not exist (i.e. you're trying to get the 3rd element from a group that only has two elements). For example, we can find the first and last departure for each day:

Here, we use again flights dataset:
```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    first_dep = first(dep_time), 
    last_dep = last(dep_time)
  )
```

- Counts: You've seen n(), which takes no arguments, and returns the size of the current group. To count the number of non-missing values, use sum(!is.na(x)). To count the number of distinct (unique) values, use n_distinct(x).

```{r}
# Which destinations have the most carriers?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(carriers = n_distinct(carrier)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(carriers))
```

Counts are so useful that dplyr provides a simple helper if all you want is a count:
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  count(dest)
```

How many apartments with more than 5 transaction:
```{r}
transactions %>% 
  count(area, transactions > 5)
```


You can optionally provide a weight variable. For example, you could use this to "count" (sum) the total number of transactions for each county:
```{r}
transactions %>% 
  count(county, wt = transactions)
```

- Counts and proportions of logical values: sum(x > 10), mean(y == 0). When used with numeric functions, TRUE is converted to 1 and FALSE to 0. This makes sum() and mean() very useful: sum(x) gives the number of TRUEs in x, and mean(x) gives the proportion.

```{r}
transactions %>% 
  group_by(area) %>% 
  summarise(N = sum(transactions > 5),
            `%` = mean(transactions > 5))
```

## Grouping by multiple variables

When you group by multiple variables, each summary peels off one level of the grouping. That makes it easy to progressively roll up a dataset:

```{r}
by_year <- transactions %>% 
  group_by(year, county, area) 
(year_county_area <- summarise(by_year, n = sum(transactions)))
```

```{r}
(year_county <- summarise(year_county_area, n = sum(n)))
```

```{r}
(year <- summarise(year_county, n = sum(n)))
```

> Be careful when progressively rolling up summaries: it's OK for sums and counts, but you need to think about weighting means and variances, and it’s not possible to do it exactly for rank-based statistics like the median. In other words, the sum of groupwise sums is the overall sum, but the median of groupwise medians is not the overall median.

## Ungrouping

If you need to remove grouping, and return to operations on ungrouped data, use ungroup().

```{r}
by_year %>% 
  ungroup() %>%             # no longer grouped by year, county and area
  summarise(N = sum(transactions))
```

### Exercises

1. Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:

  - A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.

  - A flight is always 10 minutes late.

  - A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.

  - 99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it’s 2 hours late.

  - Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?

2. Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %>% count(dest) and not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) (without using count()).

3. Our definition of cancelled flights (is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay) ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?

4. Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

5. Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()))

6. What does the sort argument to count() do. When might you use it?

## Grouped mutates (and filters)

Grouping is most useful in conjunction with summarise(), but you can also do convenient operations with mutate() and filter():

- Find the best (#1) month for each apartment type:

```{r}
transactions %>% 
  group_by(area) %>% 
  filter(rank(desc(transactions)) == 1)
```

Nothing beats Oct-Dec 2005...

- Find all groups bigger than a threshold:

```{r}
transactions %>% 
  group_by(year, county, area) %>% 
  filter(sum(transactions) > 1000)
```

- Standardise to compute per group metrics:
```{r}
year %>%
  mutate(prop_trans = n / sum(n))
```

The number of transactions was highest in ...
