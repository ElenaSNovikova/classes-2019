3. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

5. What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)

6. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ < 5)?
